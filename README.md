# PIMA-Indian-Diabetes-Dataset

## About Dataset
## Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
## Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
## Problem Statement:
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not. The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome.
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0

## Contribution towards the project:
The objective is to find a model which will be able to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not given their medical records. Various classification models will be tested against this dataset to find the one which will be best suited for this problem, so that given the symptoms we can predict the outcome of the patient before hand so that precautionary measures can be taken.
